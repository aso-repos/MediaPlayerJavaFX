# ðŸŽ¶ MediaPlayerJavaFX  

## ðŸ“Œ Goal  
The goal of this project is to create an **MP3 player** as the first module of a larger **Media Player system**, designed and styled in a traditional *hi-fi stack* format. Each module (MP3, video, image viewer, etc.) will look like a classic hi-fi component but remain fully interconnected in software.  

Special focus is placed on design clarity: all **button icons and the project logo/branding were created using CorelDRAW and FontForge**, ensuring crisp, professional-quality visuals tailored for this application.
