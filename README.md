## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create an **MP3 player** as the first module of a larger **Media Player system**, designed and styled in a traditional *hi-fi* stack format. Each module (MP3, video, image viewer, etc.) will look like a classic hi-fi component but remain fully interconnected in software.
